            <h1>Daniel Martinez</h1>
            <h3>And I'm a <span>Software Engineer</span></h3>
            <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Daniel â€” a full stack developer with a passion for problem-solving, creativity, and helping
                others succeed.

                I started my journey with a computer at age 4 in Venezuela, and since then I've been chasing the thrill
                of building and innovating. After years of working in customer service, I took the leap to pursue
                software engineering â€” and now, I merge tech skills with empathy to craft meaningful solutions.

                ðŸ’¬ Let's build something amazing together.</p>
